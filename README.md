# Query library for Lansweeper software

## Desciption

Lansweeper is an application that gathers hardware and software information of computers and other devices on a computer network for management and compliance and audit purposes. The application also encompasses a ticket based help desk system and capabilities for software updates on target devices.

The problem I have encountered is that when you use Lansweeper in a service company that has to manage the IT assets of different companies it becomes complicated to maintain reports without having to edit or modify them frequently.

This is why I created a powershell script that was much easier to maintain at the query level. This script exported the data of my queries directly into a .csv file that I could send to anyone.

These are simple queries based on my needs but they may help you create your own queries based on them.

If you wish, the script is available here https://github.com/ChristophePelichet/LansweeperReporting
